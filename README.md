## Versed

[Versed](http://versed.amrictor.com) is a lyric guessing game inspired by a trend on [Sporcle](https://www.sporcle.com/) where users create song quizzes without naming the song title, sometimes giving an album or artist, and ask the player to figure out the song by guessing common words to reveal lyrics as you go. In this version, songs are available via the Genius API and can be randomized from customizable playlists.
